# CI/CD Pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and GitHub

This project demonstrates a complete **CI/CD pipeline on AWS**, integrating **GitHub**, **AWS CodePipeline**, and **CodeBuild** to automate the build and deployment process for a static website hosted on **Amazon S3**.

This is part of my **real-time DevOps projects practice** based on concepts learned from the **AWS Zero to Hero** course.

## CI/CD Workflow Explanation

1. **Source Stage**  
   - GitHub repo is connected to CodePipeline.
   - Any new push to the main branch triggers the pipeline automatically using webhooks.

2. **Build Stage**  
   - AWS CodeBuild uses `buildspec.yml` to install dependencies, build the project, and prepare the deployment artifacts.
   - Output is stored in an S3 bucket.

3. **Deploy Stage**  
   - CodePipeline deploys the final output to the target S3 bucket.
   - The bucket is configured for static website hosting, so the application is served directly to users.
