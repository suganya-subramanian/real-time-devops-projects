# 🛒 RobotShop E-commerce Application – Deployment on AWS EKS

This project is a real-time e-commerce microservices application called **RobotShop**, deployed on **AWS EKS** as part of the *DevOps Zero to Hero* series by Abhishek Veeramalla. I have practiced this project by forking the original repository and executing the setup in my local and cloud environments.
