# 📊 OpenTelemetry Application – DevOps & Observability Project  

This project demonstrates how to implement **OpenTelemetry** in a real-time application to achieve **observability** through metrics, logs, and traces.  
It is part of my **hands-on DevOps learning** from a Udemy project, focusing on **monitoring, distributed tracing, and visualization** with modern observability tools.  

---

## 🚀 What is the Project?  
This project showcases the integration of **OpenTelemetry** for **observability** across a microservices-based application. It includes:  
- **Distributed Tracing**  
- **Metrics Collection**  
- **Logs Integration**  

The goal is to track, monitor, and visualize the system's performance and health in real-time, leveraging tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Jaeger**.
